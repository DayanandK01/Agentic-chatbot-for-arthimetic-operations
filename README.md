# ðŸ¤– Agentic Chatbot for Arithmetic Operations

A lightweight AI-powered chatbot built in Python that can understand and perform basic arithmetic operations like addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division through natural language queries. It leverages an LLM agent (e.g., OpenAI's GPT) to parse and compute user instructions intelligently.
